Minetest 5.2 mod: Motorboat
========================================

This is the "Motorboat", an hybrid of "Not So Simple Helicopter" and "Sailing Kit".
It's water dynamics comes from Sailing Kit (by TheTermos). So it depends on mobkit. And It dependes on the biofuel mod for fuel making.
It starts anchored, so press sneak key to remove anchor. With keyboard you can move the boat. When you press jump, it starts the engine and you can navigate fast, but it consumes fuel. With engine off you use paddles. You can refuel only with the engine turned off. And you can set anchor by pressing sneak, but it only works when the boat is near completely stopped (when the anchor is sucessfull, you receive a message on chat).

It can be painted using dye of any color you want, you must punch the seat with the dye.
